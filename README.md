# Quantum Key Distributions
This repository contains code for simulating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols such as BB84, E91, BBM92 and a proposed variant of BBM92 protocol. This code uses Qiskit to simulate the protocols. These have been compared on various parameters, and have been used to perform a comparative analysis.

Modifications were made to ensure compatibility with the latest version of the Qiskit SDK. Additional code was developed based on this to simulate other QKD protocols, including BB84, BBM92, and a proposed variant of BBM92.
