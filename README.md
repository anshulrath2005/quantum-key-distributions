# Quantum Key Distributions
This repository contains code for simulating Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols such as BB84, E91, BBM92 and a proposed variant of BBM92 protocol. This code uses Qiskit to simulate the protocols. These have been compared on various parameters, and have been used to perform a comparative analysis.

This code dervies its inspiration from a similar code repository that used Qiskit to simulate the E91 protocol. [Github Link](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials/blob/master/awards/teach_me_qiskit_2018/e91_qkd/e91_quantum_key_distribution_protocol.ipynb)
